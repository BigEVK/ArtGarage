                <p class="artist-bio">Color is a personâ€™s signature, a personal form of expression and another sense an artist can use to communicate.  I intermingle abstract shapes and color to energize my subjects, which include landscapes, still lifes, and figures. Sometimes I have to watch myself and not use color as a crutch. Color are my kids, you have to watch your values before they can come out to play.</p>

              <p class="about-us">Here at Art Garage we want to connect artists with potential buyers who are passionate about art. Artists are able to create a profile by introducing themselves by creating a profiling with their name, website link, a bio describing who they are as an artist and uploading a specific piece of artwork that they have to offer up for sale. If you're a potential buyer and you like a specific artist or piece of artwork you can leave a comment for everyone to read. You can even contact the artist by going to their personal website and sending them an email. Use the signup buttons below to create an account. Welcome to the Art Garage!</p>
