    <p id="full-profile-bio">Louis Escobedo was born in Sweetwater, Texas, and
      received a BFA in Advertising Art from Sam Houston State University in
      Huntsville, Texas. He began his painting career at age 6 when he won the
      best of show in his elementary school in Sweetwater Texas. In 1974, after
      graduation from college he began his career as an artist honing his
      talents to become a freelance illustrator in Texas. In 1979, he finally
      achieved his goal. During his time as an illustrator, he received a gold
      medal from the Society of Illustrators in New York in 1981 and many other
      awards from many organizations such as the Dallas Texas Visual Society.
      Louis and Yolanda currently reside in Santa Fe New Mexico. In 1985, he
      shifted his professional focus, moving from illustration to fine art. In
      1990, Louis and his wife, Yolanda, moved to Denver, Colorado. During his
      fine art career, Louis exhibited in many galleries across the United
      States, including California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois,
      Virginia, and Maryland. In 1994, Louis was awarded his first Gold Medal
      from the National Oil Painters of America (OPA) and received his second
      one with a $25,000 award in 2014. He is one of only two artists receiving
      this prestigious award twice from this 27-year-old organization. In 2019
      Louis received the Master Signature status in Oil Painters of America
      based on his mastery of oil painting and accomplishments in the world of
      representational art.

      This painting reminds me of when I was a child visiting my grandparents.
      This really takes me back and I just might put in an offer for the
      painting!
